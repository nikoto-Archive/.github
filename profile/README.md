# 🗄️ nikoto-archive

This organization stores all my old projects, experiments, unfinished ideas and early code attempts.

These repositories are kept for:
- reference and personal history,
- revisiting certain ideas in the future,
- tracking my progression as a developer,
- avoiding clutter in my main GitHub workspace.

Nothing here represents my current development standards or architectures.  
All my professional, clean and production-oriented projects are located in **nikoto-apps**.
