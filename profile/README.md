# 🗄️ nikoto-archive

Welcome to **nikoto-archive** — a storage area for all my older code, experiments, drafts and early prototypes.

## 📚 Purpose
This organization exists to:
- keep a trace of my developer evolution,
- preserve early experiments or technical tests,
- store prototypes I may want to revisit later,
- prevent clutter in my main GitHub profile.

## ⚠️ Note
The repositories here:
- are not maintained,
- do not reflect my current coding standards,
- are not part of active development.

For all my professional projects built with **Spring Boot, Angular, Docker, PostgreSQL, CI/CD and clean architectures**,  
please visit **[nikoto-apps](https://github.com/nikoto-apps)**.
